## Update on 14/03

- today growth rate decreased from 54% to 27%. However, it could still increase, due to 2 weeks incubation period, that makes spread measurements uncertain
- because of lockdown (started on March 10th), **growth rate should go to almost 0% on March 24th**
- actual risks not included in the prediction:
  - commuters going back to their city of birth, during these recent days
  - people in touch with actual infected, that could spread the virus further 
  - people from foreign countries that adopted lockdown too late (eg UK, Germany, Spain)

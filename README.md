## Update on 16/03

- growth rate back to 20%. No further insights can be derived, given lack of any pattern during recent days.

## Update on 15/03

- **growth rate drammatically increases, to 84%**, the highest in recent days. Probably still a result from the time before lockdown, or lockdown not correctly observed or not working correctly in some areas  

## Update on 14/03

- **growth rate decreased from 54% to 27%**. However, it could still increase, due to 2 weeks incubation period, that makes spread measurements uncertain
- because of lockdown (started on March 10th), **growth rate should go to almost 0% on March 24th**
- actual risks not included in the prediction:
  - commuters going back to their city of birth, happening these recent days  
  - people in touch with actual infected, that could get infected  
  - people living in foreign countries that adopted lockdown too late (eg UK, Germany, Spain) and that could travel to Italy
